# Mass-Email-Logger
a script to bypass google bot detection, login to all emails in a file email and passwords separated with :, and retrieve emails. this script is incomplete.

only works with gmail atm, but i will add yahoo, hotmail, aol etc later on. if captcha appears you will have to enter it manually, i will add auto-captcha api functionality, so you can use auto-captcha services like deathbycaptcha, 2captcha, etc.

A full description, tutorial, cleaner-code, and comments comming soon.
